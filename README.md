Code Test

● Build a form that accepts a Tumblr blog name as it’s input and use the Tumblr API to retrieve posts for that blog.

● Results should be shown 10 at a time and have correctly functioning pagination links. ie. ‘next’ link only works if there are more posts, ‘3’ link should show results 21-30, etc.

● For each post, show it’s post ID, publish date and a link to the post on Tumblr.

● You may use the following API key: fuiKNFp9vQFvjLNvx4sUwti4Yb5yGutBN4Xh10LXZhhRKjWlV4

● Use of a PHP framework is not required but strongly encouraged. You may choose the framework you are most comfortable with.

● An emphasis should not be given on design. However, the post results should still be readable
